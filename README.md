# Hands On Lab for Docker Containers - Beginner level

### Pre-work:

1. Request An **Oracle Cloud Trial**: https://cloud.oracle.com/tryit

2. Provision An Instance of **Oracle Container Cloud Service** 
  > *It is very important that this is completed before starting the Hands On Lab, or you will not have time to finish the excersises within a 2 hour timeframe.*
  
  Here are some easy guides to help you setup your first Container Cloud Service instance after you get your Oracle Cloud trial:
  
  * [Short Youtube Video for Setup and Access of Container Cloud Service:](https://youtu.be/l3H-oMRcrGo) 

Or use these other two resources for guidance on setup and access:

  * [Oracle Documentation for Setup and Access](http://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/iaas/container-cloud/contu/creating-oracle-container-cloud-service-instances.html#CONTU-GUID-6C53AF60-DD68-4B0E-9956-F387493519D7)


### Use the Participant Guide to complete the Hands On Lab:

The [Participant Guide](../master/Participant-Guide.md) walks you through a step by step Hands On Lab session, expected to take about 2 hours.   

This hands-on-lab is targeted at beginners with no prior experience and will cover the basics of using Docker. Participants will advance concepts and skills from Docker using CLI on a Docker Host/VM to higher level tools, such as Github, Docker Hub and Oracle Container Cloud Service (OCCS).
